# Godot Rust Testing
This is my test project for getting started with using rust with godot. This project can be used as a starting place for future godot-rust projects as well.

## To Run
cd into the rust directory, then run `cargo build`, then you can run the godot project

# Further Information
More information about using rust with godot can be found in the [documentation website](https://godot-rust.github.io/book/index.html).
